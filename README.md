Reading apps that I developed for P.S. 161

This app was used to teach billingual first graders at P.S. 161 how to differentiate short "a" and "i." After clicking start, the user is shown multiple images of objects with short "a" or "i" in them (e.g. bat, bit, hit, hat). Using the Speech Synthesis API, the words are read aloud to them, so a connection can be formed between the sound of the letters and the letters themselves. The app is easily scalable for other letters and letter combinations.
